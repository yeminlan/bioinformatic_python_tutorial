# bioinformatic_python_tutorial
> Tutorial for sequence handling using python

> Including step by step python scripts to (main.sh):
- concatenate forward and reverse fastq files
- extract reads whose barcode start with A or T (for the sack of practice) 
- convert fastq to fasta file 
- delete N's in fasta file
- format fasta file so that each read takes two lines (header & seq)
- count number of bases for each read, output a tab-separated values (TSV) file
- get reverse complement DNA sequences
- translate nucleotides to proteins

> Using BioPython to do the same steps (biopython_tutorial.py).
